Stream Bingo for [BendyJenga](https://www.twitch.tv/bendyjenga) on Twitch

# Instructions / How to Play

## Click [here](https://raa-ji.github.io/bendy-bingo/) to play the game!

## Rules:

### 1:
Each time you load or reload the page, you will get a new set of "boxes" randomly selected. Each box represents something that may happen on a BendyJenga stream.

### 2:
When something listed on one of your boxes happens on the stream, click the box. Clicking the box will highlight it in red.
(Note that you cannot currently un-check a box; once you've clicked it, it will remain highlighted)
For example, if Bendy falls to her death in the game she's playing you can check that box (assuming you have it).

### 3:
You automatically get the "FREE!" space in the middle, because Bendy will always wind up muting herself to cough during the stream ;-)

### 4:
The first person to have all boxes in a line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) wins the game! You should probably provide a screenshot or something just to prove you actually won.

### 5:
That's it! That's the game. Have fun!
